# Learning Android App Development

This organization contains the small projects I made during the mobile development course at Birzeit University. They include:

* A Timer app
* A Small App that shows off the different kinds of screens
* A Cafe app to demonstrate how to move between screens
* An application that displays all of the elements of the periodic table as buttons where clicking an element displays information about it
* A small library app that was made in the first lecture

At the end of the course I created a project called Hotel Hub that uses some advance concepts that can be found on my personal page.
